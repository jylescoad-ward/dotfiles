PLATINUM GTK2 THEME DESIGNED FOR THE XFCE DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT

CREDITS AND GENRAL INFORMATION:
===============================

This theme is a combination Mac-OS-X DP and Classic Platinum Streamlined themes found on opendesktop.org to specially suit XFCE4 looks.

I DO NOT own anything inside of this combination and everything found here belongs to the themes created by libertyernie on www.opendesktop.org (Classic Platinum Streamlined) and the creator of Mac-OS-X DP that I couldn't find who sourced the assets from older Mac operating systems.
The original assets belong to Apple inc.

INSTALLATION:
=============

Place the PLATINUM folder in /home/[yourusername]/.themes 
for only the user you want to have access to it.
If you'd like it to be available to everyone
including root place it in /usr/share/themes.
If you don't know how use this command in the terminal:
"sudo mv [the PLATINUM folder location eg. /home/kacper/downloads/PLATINUM] /usr/share/themes"
